<div class="presentation-title"><strong>Presentation: Robot Arm Collision Avoidance and Onboard Sensors </strong></div>
<div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Sensors are required to detect obstacles near a robot manipulator. While depth cameras are the most common scene perception technology, we look at alternatives that give information originating from the robot body itself (on-board sensors). For robots to be physically located within human–laden environments, advances are needed in both control and sensing technology. We will look at formulations and execution of real-time control methods for robot manipulator collision avoidance around dynamic objects and how to perceive objects in real-time.</div>

<div class="presentation-title"><strong>Presentation: Bridging The Gap Between Robots and Humans Through Explainability </strong></div>
<div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Robots are traditionally placed behind fences for autonomous pick-and-place tasks. Today, we are witnessing robots moving to work with humans. They will not only need to manipulate but also hand objects to people and explain when autonomy fails. In this talk, I will start with how I tackled challenges in mobile manipulation tasks in a collaborative environment and a better way to let objects go for fluent human-robot handovers. Then I will focus on high-level hierarchical explanation generation algorithms using behavior trees and finer-level references for preferred concise explanations. This includes reference production through a cognitive status-informed approach and mixed-reality robot behavior replays to reason about objects no longer present. Finally, I will discuss how augmented reality can enable physically limited robots to gesture.</div>

<div class="presentation-title"><strong>Presentation: A Neural Model for Relative-Motion Perception </strong></div>
<div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Our visual system uses a variety of reference frames. Beginning from the retinas, through the optics of the eye, images of neighboring points in the environment are mapped onto neighboring photoreceptors in the retina. The resulting retinal stimulus representations are called retinotopic maps. However, the perception of motion doesn’t only depend on the retinotopic reference-frame, but also on choosing and applying non-retinotopic reference-frames based on the motion signals to be interpreted. In this study, we propose a neural model that implements the common-fate principle for non-retinotopic reference- frame selection. The first layer of the model extracts retinotopic motion signals. Through synaptic projections, the next layer computes the common-motion vector, which is then used as a reference-frame. Based on the determined non-retinotopic reference-frame, later layers compute the relative motion of each visual element. This talk will discuss the neural structures, electrical-circuit abstracts for neural behaviors, and mathematical descriptions used in this project. It will also show the simulation results of this model with multiple classical relative motion stimuli, including the three-dot, rotating-wheel, and point-walker paradigms. Finally, the performance of this model will be compared with the results of our psychophysical experiments and previously proposed models.</div>

<div class="presentation-title"><strong>Presentation: Categories for Knowledge Representation</strong></div>
<div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Rigorous knowledge representation is essential to modeling engineered systems, ensuring interoperability and extensibility, and to the design of systems with artificial intelligence capable of processing knowledge autonomously or in collaboration with humans. Human knowledge is often centered around binary relationships, which explains why directed graphs, and graph databases built on them, are frequently used for knowledge capture. However, knowledge is also <em>compositional</em>, in that relationships can be composed to form new relationships. In this context, I will review <em>categories</em> as a generalization of graphs, as a foundation for knowledge engineering, leading up to recent work on using <em>higher category theory</em> to capture two dimensions of relationships: both relationships between individual entities and relationships between the <em>types</em> of those entities and relationships.</div>

<div class="presentation-title"><strong>Presentation: Using mm-Wave Radar for Non-Contact Heart Rate Monitoring</strong></div>
<div class="abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Extracting accurate heart rate estimates of human subjects from a distance in high-noise scenarios using radar is a common problem. Often, frequency components from sources such as movement and vital signs from other subjects can overpower the weak reflected signal of the heart. In this study, we propose a signal-processing scheme using an Adaptive Multi-Trace Carving algorithm (AMTC) to accurately detect the heart rate signal over time in non-ideal scenarios using a mm-wave radar. In our initial proof-of-concept results, we show a low heart rate estimation mean absolute error (MAE) of 3 bpm for a single subject marching in place and less than 4.5 bpm for a scenario of two human subjects at the same distance from the radar.</p>

<div class="presentation-title"><strong>Presentation: Understanding Neural Collapse in Deep Learning</strong></div>
<div class="abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: In the past decade, the revival of deep neural networks has led to dramatic success in numerous applications ranging from computer vision, to natural language processing, to scientific discovery and beyond. Nevertheless, the practice of deep networks has been shrouded with mystery as our theoretical understanding for the success of deep learning remains elusive.</p>
<p>In this talk, we will focus on the representations learned by deep neural networks. For example, <em>neural collapse</em> is an intriguing empirical phenomenon that persists across different neural network architectures and a variety of standard datasets. This phenomenon implies that (i) the class means and the last-layer classifiers all collapse to the vertices of a Simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) up to scaling, and (ii) cross-example within-class variability of last-layer activations collapses to zero. We will provide a geometric analysis for understanding why this happens on a simplified unconstrained feature model. We will also exploit these findings to improve training efficiency: we can set the feature dimension equal to the number of classes and fix the last-layer classifier to be a Simplex ETF for network training, reducing memory cost by over 20% on ResNet18 without sacrificing the generalization performance.</p>

<div class="presentation-title"><strong>Presentation: 3D Non-Line-of-Sight Imaging Using Terahertz Signals</strong></div>
<div class="abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Although traditional optical cameras can produce high-resolution pictures, using a terahertz (THz) camera, we can see objects that are not only in the direct line-of-sight but also occluded. This can inspire new applications ranging from autonomous navigation to wireless communications.</p>
<p>In this talk, we propose a THz non-line-of-sight (NLoS) imaging method that can help us reveal invisible targets behind occlusions. This method takes advantage of wave scattering from LoS rough surfaces to transmit signals to the NLoS scene. We show that common building materials can perform similar to mirrors in the THz range such that an NLoS scene can be imaged via the signal specular reflections from them. However, this phenomenon also results in incorrect raw images as the NLoS objects would appear at the wrong locations with false orientations. Therefore, we introduce the mirror folding method which can account for the signal reflections and correct the raw images. We also demonstrate the proposed THz NLoS imaging approach using experiments in various scenarios. The results show that the hidden scene can be properly reconstructed with centimeter-scale resolution at several meters away.</p>

<div class="presentation-title"><strong>Presentation: Cooperative Bayesian Intelligence for Aerospace Autonomy</strong></div>
<div class="abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: As imperfectly designed agents in an uncertain world, autonomous systems will never work "out of the box" exactly as desired. By taking on tasks that push the technological limit, autonomous systems will encounter unexpected situations that go beyond their immediate capabilities. Autonomous systems must therefore be able to continuously and independently gather, process, and act on imperfect information. They must also be cognizant of what they can and cannot accomplish on their own and know when/how to seek help. In aerospace applications and beyond, scalable human-machine and machine-machine interactions will be essential for reinforcing the core perception, planning, learning, and reasoning algorithms that make machine autonomy on any one platform possible.</p>
<p>This talk will discuss innovative Bayesian algorithmic approaches developed by the COHRINT Lab at CU Boulder that enable autonomous systems to opportunistically leverage different available kinds of human-machine and machine-machine interaction while performing challenging tasks in the presence of complex uncertainties. I will focus in detail on our group’s work on probabilistic modeling, inference, and optimization techniques for augmenting autonomous state estimation and decision-making algorithms running onboard autonomous systems with inputs from human teammates, task assistants and supervisors. I will describe how our approaches connect rigorous statistical modeling and learning techniques with "plug-and-play" semantic interfaces that can readily adapt to a variety of applications and users. Results from aerospace applications such as unmanned air/ground reconnaissance, missile defense, and space robotics will show how our methods allow human-machine systems to "cut knots and fill in gaps" in fundamentally novel ways for challenging problems.</p>

<div class="presentation-title"><strong>Presentation: Emulating Modern SDN and NFV Networks: The <em>ComNetsEmu</em> Environment</strong></div>
<div class="abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Networks are evolving rapidly under the pressure of the emerging Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) paradigms. Indeed, the joint usage of SDN and NFV is increasing the programmability of networks and supported services, introducing new and vital concepts such as network slicing and, in general, allowing the introduction of computing in communication networks. As a consequence, the path towards network automation and autonomous networking is now open. In this fast-changing scenario, effective training of network engineers requires a hands-on approach. Some software environments are available for separately studying and testing solutions in SDN (<em>Mininet</em>) or NFV (<em>Docker</em>). This presentation will introduce a holistic network emulation software, <em>ComNetsEmu</em>, capable of providing to users the capability to experiment with building blocks of modern networks (SDN &amp; NFV), directly on their own laptops and supported by several practical examples. Besides introducing the emulator design, the presentation will offer an overview of the practical capabilities of the <em>ComNetsEmu</em> environment and some demonstration of related applications.</p>

<div class="presentation-title"><strong>Presentation: Deep learning Techniques for Hybrid Beamforming in Communications and Radar</strong></div>
<div class="abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) massive MIMO communications employ hybrid analog-digital beamforming architectures to reduce the cost-power-size-hardware overheads. Lately, there is also a gradual push to move from the millimeter-wave (mmWave) to Terahertz (THz) frequencies for short-range communications and radar applications to exploit very wide THz bandwidths. The design of the hybrid beamforming techniques requires solving difficult nonconvex optimization problems that involve a common performance metric as a cost function and a number of constraints related to the employed communications/radar regime and the adopted architecture of the hybrid systems. There is no standard methodology for solving such problems and usually, the derivation of an efficient solution is a very challenging task. Since optimization-based approaches suffer from high computational complexity and their performance strongly relies on the perfect channel condition, we introduce deep learning (DL) techniques that provide robust performance while designing a hybrid beamformer. These methods offer advantages such as low computational complexity and the ability to extrapolate new features from a limited set of features contained in a training set. In this talk, the audience will learn about applying DL to various aspects of hybrid beamforming including channel estimation, antenna selection, wideband beamforming, knowledge transfer across various geometries, and spatial modulation in both communications and radar.</p>

<div class="presentation-title"><strong>Presentation: How Robotics are Revolutionizing Rehabilitation</strong></div>
<div class="abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Capitalizing on the new understanding of brain plasticity, we introduced a paradigm shift in clinical practice in 1989 when we initiated the development of the MIT-Manus robot for neuro-rehabilitation and deployed it into the clinic. Since then we collected evidence to support the potential of enhancing and augmenting recovery following a stroke, first during the sub- acute and then the chronic phase. Our efforts and that of others led to the endorsements starting in 2010 from the American Heart Association, the American Stroke Association, and the Veterans Administration for the use of rehabilitation robots for the Upper Extremity, but not yet for the Lower Extremity. AHA recommendations were the same in the 2016 revision. Furthermore, it was demonstrated in the VA system that upper extremity robotic therapy has an economic advantage over manual therapy. More recently we completed a pragmatic study RATULS under the auspices of the National Health Service of the United Kingdom and its NIHR Health Technology Assessment Programme, which enrolled 770 stroke patients. Thus, we have developed novel robotic treatment and evaluation tools and have managed to collect the experimental evidence that demonstrates the unequivocal therapeutic benefits stemming from robot-aided rehabilitation for the upper extremity as well as present shortcomings. This talk will present an overview of our past rehabilitation robotics efforts and more recent efforts addressing the identified shortcomings.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;padding-left: 10px"><span data-contrast="auto">Abstract: This presentation focuses on the role that notions of agency play in the design of language-capable interactive robots. I will begin by explaining the overall impact that robot design choices have on how people perceive robots and expect them to behave. I’ll then explain why robots are not simply agents, but are also moral and social agents, and describe the work the MIRRORLab has been doing to understand and address the unique perceptions and expectations that come along with these more nuanced types of agency. In doing so, I will cover not only the computational aspects of our work, but also the way that our work is informed by theories and methods from psychology (cognitive, human factors, social, and moral), philosophy (of mind, of language, of morality), linguistics, design, and other fields.</span></p>

<h3>Presentation: <strong>Data Driven Decisions and Continuous Improvement </strong></h3>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;padding-left: 10px"><span data-contrast="auto">Abstract: </span>While “data driven decision making” is a concept that is professed to be used across industries, executives still tend to lean toward trusting their gut and using heuristics in their decision making process. By considering the experiences of the audience, the context of the decision space, and the data being presented, we can help consumers of information overcome their intuitive biases and make decisions based on data. Drawing from his experiences of using data to influence behavior in a manufacturing environment, Kevin Havis will explore three factors to consider when evaluating how to use data, bringing a systems thinking perspective to the art of using data convincingly. We will discuss how to present data in a way that makes conclusions obvious and actionable with a final goal of improving your future projects quality and time to build. Finally, we will review some common errors when presenting data within hardware and software projects and systems engineering and how to use the lean technique of “Plan-Do-Check-Adjust” to arrive at great organization and visuals that will propel your program in to ever improved qualities.</p>

<h3>Presentation:<strong>Defeating traffic analysis attacks: challenges and countermeasures</strong></h3>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;padding-left: 10px">Abstract: While encryption protects communications from on-path eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks, it does not protect them against privacy threats realized via advanced traffic analysis algorithms. Traffic analysis refers to ever-growing side-channel attacks that rely on sophisticated machine learning algorithms to enable an on-path attacker to classify the encrypted packets based on unencryptable features of the traffic, such as packet sizes, counts, and timings which are not modified by the encryption algorithms, to infer sensitive information from eavesdropped encrypted communications. Examples include traffic analysis attacks that identify the spoken language or even the speaker in a conversation over encrypted VoIP packets or visited web pages or other user activities from encrypted HTTP packets. In this talk, we first provide an overview of traffic analysis attacks and show that existing countermeasures like packet padding are in no way sufficient or effective in addressing them. We then discuss the characteristics of an ideal defense mechanism for obfuscating footprints of encrypted traffic. Finally, we discuss a novel approach based on proactive cyber defense paradigms, including moving target defense and cyber deception, to realize this ideal countermeasure against traffic analysis attacks.</p>

<h3>Presentation: <strong>Medical Capsule Robots: A Fantastic Voyage</strong></h3>
</div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;padding-left: 10px">Abstract: At the beginning of the new millennia, wireless capsule endoscopy was introduced as a minimally invasive method of inspecting the digestive tract. The possibility of collecting images deep inside the human body just by swallowing a “pill” revolutionized the field of gastrointestinal endoscopy and sparked a brand-new field of research in robotics: <em>medical capsule robots</em>. These are self-contained robots that leverage extreme miniaturization to access and operate in environments that are out of reach for larger devices. In medicine, capsule robots can enter the human body through natural orifices or small incisions, and detect and cure life-threatening diseases in a non-invasive manner. This talk will provide a perspective on how this field has evolved in the last ten year. We will explore what was accomplished, what has failed, and what were the lessons learned. We will also discuss enabling technologies, intelligent control, possible levels of computer assistance, and highlight future challenges in this ongoing <em>Fantastic Voyage</em>.</p>

Before joining Toyota, Dr. Deshmukh was the 2010 Computing Innovation Post-Doctoral Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania under the mentorship of Rajeev Alur.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;padding-left: 10px">Dr. Deshmukh  was awarded his Ph.D. in computer engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 2010, where he was advised by E. Allen Emerson - a recipient of the prestigious A.M. Turing Award. Dr. Deshmukh's current research interests include the application of formal methods to reason about cyber-physical systems, verification and testing of embedded control systems, real-time temporal logic, and analyzing time-series data. He is particularly interested in studying cyber-physical systems that use machine learning based components, such as autonomous driving vehicles.</p>

<h3>Presentation: <strong>Specification-driven Design of Autonomous Systems </strong></h3>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;padding-left: 10px">Abstract: Machine learning-based techniques such as deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL) have shown a lot of promise in automatically synthesizing controllers for autonomous cyber-physical systems that operate in uncertain environments. The basic idea in RL is to treat the control software as an agent to be trained; in each state, the agent performs some action, and the environment probabilistically determines its next state and the reward that it should receive. RL algorithms try to maximize the payoff that the agent would receive over a long-term horizon. Deep RL algorithms extend RL by using deep neural networks to model functions that map states (and actions) to expected rewards, and/or the control policy for the agent. In general, RL algorithms crucially rely on an expert user to design state-based localized reward functions with the understanding that desired system behavior occurs when the reward payoff is optimized. Unfortunately, there are documented cases of reward hacking: where the agent learns to maximize the reward while exhibiting undesirable or unsafe behavior. Thus, for adoption of deep RL algorithms in the design of safety-critical autonomous systems, it is important to carefully design reward functions. In this talk, we propose a new paradigm for (deep) RL algorithms, where instead of providing state-based rewards, the user specifies the desired behavior of the system using a formal specification language (such as Signal Temporal Logic or STL). We then explore two different approaches for a systematic inference of reward functions: the first in which we map STL specifications to localized state-based rewards, and the other in which we combine the system specification with user-provided demonstrations to learn safer control policies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our technique on examples from the autonomous driving domain.</p>

<h3>Presentation: <strong>Perspectives and Connections: From Control Theory to Intelligent Robots to Cooperative Autonomy </strong></h3>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;padding-left: 10px">Abstract: In this talk we give perspectives on the problem of devising autonomous systems by describing several threads of research from the speaker’s experience. After a brief introduction to the past and present of robotics at the Colorado School of Mines, we begin showing how a control-theoretic point of view can be exploited to develop single-entity autonomous systems, such as mobile robots and autonomous systems that can be considered “intelligent.” We emphasize a system engineering view on the conceptual design and integration of (a) the components used in unmanned systems, including the locomotion, sensors, and computing systems needed to provide inherent autonomy capability, and (b) the algorithms and architectures needed to enable control and autonomy, including path-tracking control and high-level planning strategies. We then consider the use of multiple autonomous systems that cooperate to achieve a collective goal, primarily via the theoretical notion of “consensus.” Throughout the talk concepts are illustrated using case study examples from robotic and unmanned systems developed by the author and his colleagues over the past 20 years. Further, throughout the talk we provide comments on research that may be helpful to students and professional practitioners, emphasizing the importance of connections between what at times might seem to be disparate research areas that come together to enable advances.</p>

<h3>Presentation: <strong>Ethics in Programming and Computer Gaming</strong></h3>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;padding-left: 10px">Abstract: Current code of ethics and professional conduct in programming, as recommended by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), includes such ethical principles as avoid causing harm to users, respect users’ privacy, and fulfilling one’s social responsibilities. Although ACM’s code of ethics encourages programmers to operate in good faith and consider their responsibilities to a society or nation, the code does not address how programmers, bound by a company’s code of ethics while acting at the behest of the company’s corporate interests, should respond to ethical challenges that arise as companies expand across national borders, such as surveillance capitalism, cultural and moral relativism, or globalization and nationalism. This presentation will examine current ethical problems in the technology and the gaming industries and proposes a re-examination of ethics in programming by revisiting the moral philosophies of Foote, Nietzsche, Rachels, and other thinkers.</p>

<h3>Presentation: <strong>Individual Entity Journeys, Aggregated Entity Journeys and Process Maps </strong></h3>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;padding-left: 10px">Abstract: An entity is a customer who interacts with an organization in several different ways that may be categorized as customer journey. Some customer journey examples include; a user phone call where one clicks on an option then gets transferred to a particular agent and then finally completes the call and a customer who may be browsing a website and then adds items to a cart and purchases something. This journey can be for any entity, not just a customer, but also for products, services, etc. For a company, to make decisions they cannot just look at each individual customer journey rather they need to look at the bigger picture and if necessary drill down to the individual customer journey. In this presentation, we will look at how to aggregate different entity journeys together to create what we call a process map. This way of combining gives us the actual process and derived from the data. We will look at examples of entity journeys and process journeys from the standpoint of a graph database. The major takeaways for audience will be how to look at events happening over time and the final outcome and how they relate to each other. Please come and join use for an outstanding presentation on cutting edge database technology. Please join us in learning more about Database theory and the real applications of cutting edge Database design.</p>

<h3>Presentation: <strong>Application for Quantum Memory</strong></h3>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;padding-left: 10px">Abstract: This presentation will focus on developing a specific Application for Quantum Memory to hold data in a superimposing fashion so that an infinite amount of data can be stored without ever running out of memory space. The application is a concept in evolution, developed for storing digital images into the memory bank consisting of many quantum bits. Instead of using the traditional concept of data storage in a digital computer where a block of memory is used to store only one set of data and afterward this block is reserved so that no further storing is possible, this application proposes to use the same block of quantum memory to store new data repeatedly and indefinitely. Thus, algorithms for storing and retrieving data are developed, and numerical simulations are presented to demonstrates the work-ability of the concept.</p>

<h3>Presentation: <strong>Robotics Research and Development</strong></h3>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;padding-left: 10px">Abstract: There has been a promise of robots and artificial intelligence to serve mankind in a futuristic machine age.  A major topic has been the role of automation and the role of human operators.  The required technologies are moving so fast, it is hard to say where this technology will lead us.  Both a robot and its environment can be complex, represented by uncertainties that has driven a need for autonomy.  There has been some successes in robotics such as the Mars Rovers.  In the beginning of the movement smart robot systems as demonstrated by research programs in exoskeletons, autonomous navigation, walking machines, military vehicles, aerial drones, polymorphic robots, and satellite servicing systems for spacecraft.  This talk will review the state of the art of the technology, the successes, and were we plan to be tomorrow.  This future may be predicated on machines that are able to think, learn, and reason about itself and its environment.  We touch on Moore’s law, the upcoming singularity, and the validity of the Turing test for intelligence.  Based on thirty years of hands-on-experience in this field, we take a look at current trends in both robotics and direction of artificial intelligence.</p>

<h3>Presentation: <strong>Building Real Time Recommendation Engines</strong></h3>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;padding-left: 10px">Abstract: We are seeing recommendation engines at work everywhere. When we switch on Netflix, the shows that we see on the screen are coming from a recommendation engine. When we search google, the results that come as well as the ads that are displayed are the result of a complex interplay of several recommendation engines. In this presentation we will look at the mathematics behind Recommendation Engines. The talk will be a presentation but attendees can follow the presenter by getting their hands dirty in building a simple recommendation engine that uses a collaborative filter. (The tutorial will show how to Build an actual recommendation engine that makes recommendations for product purchases and movie recommendations.)   This presentation will describe how a graph database is useful when it comes to recommendations.

<h3>Presentation: <strong>Modernizing Computer Architecture Education after the death of Moore's Law</strong></h3>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;padding-left: 10px">Abstract: Is it the death of Moore's Law that has limited the growth in performance of computers or did a different law breakdown? Dennard Scaling, the concept that as silicon technology node shrinks, the power proportionally will be reduced. For example, if the silicon processing node shrinks in half, power would be reduced in half allowing twice the number of transistors to be on the chip and dissipate the same power as the preceding technology. With Dennard Scaling beginning to breakdown around 2006, the number of transistors could still be added at the cost of dissipating more and more heat. Over the last several years, the power wall has been reached limiting the general processing performance growth from doubling every two years to 3-5%. The demands and requirements for processing power are far out pacing our ability to create faster and faster general processors. To meet today's and future requirements, Application/Domain Specific Computer Architectures will need to be deployed. These architectures can be targeted specific processor cores or cores with customized processing elements to optimize the solution. This talk will discuss Computer Architecture in undergraduate education and possible new ways that Computer Architecture should be taught. We welcome you and hope to see you there, this is going to be a great event!</p>

<h3>Presentation: <strong><b>Anti Money Laundering in Distributed Ledger Technology – Cross Border Alliance</b></strong></h3>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;padding-left: 10px">Abstract: Nontrade financial transactions that cross a border and do not route through traditional banking channels provoke economic instability in a given country. However, the rise of transaction laundering into prominence demanded strict banking regulatory enforcement action. The high banking transaction cost and rigidity of the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) governance structure are the impetus of business users to seek alternative operations. Stealthy shadow banks are persistent as a medium for money laundering, corruption, and terrorism financing for a cyber attack against existing transaction systems. This presentation will identify the detection and investigation of transaction laundering to combat terrorism financing and corruption. We will use the whole of government approach to support AML activities by deploying distributed ledger technology across existing services to significantly improve foreign exchange earnings of countries.

<p style="margin-left: 20px;padding-left: 10px">Abstract: The Hybrid Intelligent Interface is a software system that bridges human and complex environments as a user-friendly interface for convenience and service. Ideal Human Computer Interfaces need a hybrid solution with ontology, natural language understanding, and machine learning tools. This work investigates how to combine understanding and learning in to a system of principles. Of course, each of these tasks has very high complexity, so we need to look for partial restricted solutions. Current solutions can reduce complexity so each subject area may accomplish function while adding user experience and a better understanding of what General AI is and what architecture it should have.  This presentation presupposes the existence of examples of concepts processed by Machine Learning methods and the ability to use them in ontology and related procedures.</p>

<h3>Presentation: <strong>Technical Presentations for Engineers</strong></h3>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;padding-left: 10px">Abstract: We have been taught since childhood that should not speak up. We try to break our years of training but it is still hard to present or speak up in public. As presenters we speak with practice but at times we can loose ourselves to uncontrollable fight or flight emotion. However, we may all develop confidence at speaking then use our technical knowledge to become great speakers. Within this presentation, we will talk about our future presentation’s purpose, construction, organization, and the delivery. This presentation explains how to easily aurally and visually depict complex information in the simplest and most logical fashion. This presentation focuses on building future presenters as “audience centered speakers” and how to use presentation tools that engage, communicate, motivate, and direct the audience. Public speaking may be thought of as an art but there are skills that we may used to develop our presentations from the most basic to the award winning.</p>

<h3>Presentation: <strong>Webcomponents</strong></h3>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;padding-left: 10px">Abstract: HTML, CSS and javascript are the foundational technologies for web development on the client side. However, developing modern, richly interactive and highly dynamic applications demands thinking in terms of higher-order concepts, such as UI widgets, behaviors, idioms, experiences, etc. Web Components are one approach to addressing this complexity. Web Components are a set of W3C specifications, rooted fundamentally in HTML, CSS, javascript, which are implemented directly by the browsers. We will identify the specific standards that comprise this technology and, from the perspective of Google's Polymer library, show how these extensions work together to create custom tags. We will further illustrate the use of custom components in a small but non-trivial application. Finally, we will discuss the challenges to adopting Web Components.</p>

<h3>Presentation: <strong>Software Project Management</strong></h3>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;padding-left: 10px">Abstract: This one-day morning seminar addresses the challenges, strategies, and tools for managing software projects. The seminar is structured according to the knowledge areas of the Project Management Body of Knowledge. Customer relationship management, decision making, earned value, critical path, critical chain, and agile methodologies will be discussed. Effective project management is a prerequisite for meeting commitments, yet all too many software projects fail to meet customer expectations for budget, schedule, functionality, and quality. Many customers now require their suppliers to demonstrate their commitment to process improvement and quality management by using, or being certified against, various models and standards. Project management is a fundamental requirement to achieve Level 2 against the Capability Maturity Integration (CMMI) for Development or to be certified against ISO 9001.</p>

<h3>Presentation: <strong>The Art of DNA Strings: Data Storage</strong></h3>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;padding-left: 10px">Abstract: This one-day morning seminar addresses the of science, capabilities, and mathematical technology  surrounding DNA data storage systems. The seminar presented coding theory, error correction, encryption, and data transfer to and from DNA computational and storage devices. Digital DNA based devices are cutting edge technology and are out of the hands of many in the consumer markets. However, larger companies and research institutes are racing forward with biological and computational technology. In our computational world storage has been a fundamental need and life has chosen DNA to store the blueprint of life in more complexity then our greatest engineering efforts. the integration of biologic template in to storage is becoming a basic computing primitive as it represents information in many differing formats and digital DNA has the ability to provide more size and capability than any current technology. Modern Humans are generating data every day from digital media such as cameras, the Internet, phones, sensors and there is a pressing need for a technology that can store this data in the dense storage medium. It is predicted that soon the data generated will be in the order of Geopbytes (10^30) from the Internet of Things. Synthetic data storage seems to be the right technology emerging on the horizon.</p>
